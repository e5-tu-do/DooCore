   *  @brief Helper class for safe file locking among shared file systems without locking specific support
   *
   *  This is a helper class to get locking functionality that's independent of 
   *  any filesystem locking capabilities and also works on shared filesystems
   *  without specific lock support. Locks are advisory, i.e. access to the file
   *  is never actually locked for any file access attempt not using FileLock.
   *  The locks are implemented via lock files where the lock file name is 
   *  unique in a way that it contains host name and process ID information.
   *
   *  Especially shared file systems have no or little support for atomic 
   *  operations and so race conditions can occur. Therefore, multiple accesses
   *  cannot be excluded completely. Use with caution.
   *
   *  Also locking a file requires write access to the directory the file is 
   *  stored in (the lock file needs to be seen by anyone who can see the locked
   *  file, thus the only safe place is the same directory).
   *
   *  @todo: Resolve links, if file is a link

     *  For locking a lock file will be created. Afterwards, a grace time of 1 s
     *  will be waited and the lock file count will be checked again. If there 
     *  is only the just created lock file, the lock is treated as successful.
     *  If there will be more than one lock file after the grace time, the race
     *  condition has occured.
